This project provides a simple and intuitive API for functional testing of Swing user interfaces, resulting in tests 
that are compact, easy to write, and read like a specification. Tests written using AssertJ Swing are also robust. 
AssertJ Swing simulates actual user gestures at the operating system level, ensuring that the application will behave correctly in 
front of the user. It also provides a reliable mechanism for GUI component lookup that ensures that changes in the GUI's 
layout or look-and-feel will not break your tests.
